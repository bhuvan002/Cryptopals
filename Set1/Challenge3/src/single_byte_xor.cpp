	to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious \
	Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put \
	her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of \
	the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, \
	the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a \
